    <h1><u>Blockchain</u></h1>
    <hr>
    <p><i><u>From wikipedia the free encyclopedia</u></i></p>
    <P>A <b>blockchain</b> is <mark>a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks)</mark> that are securely
        linked together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
        previous block,<del> a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree,</del> where data
        nodes are represented by leaves).<br> Since each block contains information about the previous block, they
        effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones
        before it. <br>Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data
        in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

    <P>first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and
        Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<br><sup>[10]</sup>Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of
        blocks was
        described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system
        wherein
        document timestamps could not be tampered with.<br> In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated
        Merkle
        trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected
        into one block.<br><sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been
        published in <i>The
            New York Times</i>every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup></P>

    <h2>structure and desing</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks
        that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> <br>This allows the
        participants to verify
        and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[21] A blockchain database is managed
        autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
        collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow
        where
        participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal.<br> The use of a blockchain removes the
        characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
        transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as
        a <i>value-exchange protocol</i>.<sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly
        set up to detail
        the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[<i>citation
                needed<i>]</sup><br>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[24]</sup>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware) </li>
        <il>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[25]</sup> and verification) </il>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>uses</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed
        ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured
        from proof of concept by late 2016.[52] As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and
        conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back
        office.[77]

        In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an
        89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp has estimated that corporate
        investment into blockchain technology will reach $12.4 billion by 2022.[78] Furthermore, According to
        PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain
        technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's
        estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business
        executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which
        indicates a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.[79]

        In 2019, the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy identified
        blockchain as a technology that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society. The economist
        and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford discussed why the underlying technology might have
        much wider applications and the challenges that needed to be overcome.[80] His first broadcast was on June 29,
        2019.

        The number of blockchain wallets quadrupled to 40 million between 2016 and 2020.[81]
